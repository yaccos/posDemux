\usage{
create_summary_res(
  retained_sequences,
  barcodes,
  assigned_barcodes,
  allowed_mismatches,
  mismatches
)
}
\arguments{
\item{retained_sequences}{Logical vector with the same length as
the number of reads in the input to the demultiplexer.
\code{TRUE} if the corresponding read
is retained. Corresponds to the field \code{retained} of the output of
\code{\link{filter_demultiplex_res}}.}

\item{barcodes}{A list of \code{\link{XStringSet}} objects in the same order they
appear in \code{sequences}, the barcodes
to be used for demultiplexing. All of the barcodes in each \code{\link{XStringSet}} must
have the same length as specified by the \code{segment_lengths} argument and be named.
For computational reasons, the maximum possible length of an individual barcode
is 127.}

\item{assigned_barcodes}{Character matrix of the assigned barcodes
Corresponds to of the field \code{assigned_barcodes}
of \code{\link{combinatorial_demultiplex}}}

\item{allowed_mismatches}{Integer vector of length one or the same length
as the number of barcode segments, the maximum Hamming distance from including
a read in the output.}

\item{mismatches}{Integer matrix of the number of mismatches of each assigned barcode
Corresponds to the field \code{mismatches} of
\code{\link{combinatorial_demultiplex}}}
}
\value{
A list of S3 class \code{demultiplex_filter_summary}
providing diagnostics for the filtering process. It contains the
the following fields:
\itemize{
\item \code{n_reads}: The total number of reads in the dataset before filtering.
\item \code{n_removed}: The number of reads removed by filtering.
\item \code{n_barcode_sets}: The number of barcode sets.
\item \code{n_barcode_combinations}: The possible number
of barcode combinations.
\item \code{n_unique_barcodes}: The number of observed unique barcode combinations
(i.e. cells) detected after filtering mismatches.
\item \code{n_estimated_cells}: The estimated number of cells having a
detected combination of barcodes.
This number will always be greater or equal than \code{n_unique_barcodes} due
to barcode collisions
\item \code{observed_collision_lambda}: The ratio of observed barcode
combinations divided by the total number of possible barcode combinations
\item \code{corrected_collision_lambda}: The ratio of estimated number of cells
to the total number of possible barcode combinations
\item \code{expected_collisions}: The statistically expected number
of barcode collisions or more precicely the expected number of
observed barcodes which correspond to two or more cells
\item \code{barcode_summary}: A list containing a summary for each barcode set.
Each element contains the following:
\itemize{
\item \code{width}: The width (number of nucleotides) of the barcode set.
\item \code{n_barcodes}: Number of query barcodes.
\item \code{n_allowed_mismatches}: Number of allowed mismatches for the barcode set.
\item \code{n_removed}: Number of reads having too many mismatches for this barcode set.
\item \code{mismatch_frame}: A \code{data.frame} with the two columns,
\code{n_mismatches} and \code{frequency} showing the number of reads for each
of the allowed number of mismatches for the given barcode set.

\description{
This is a helper function in order to create a summary of the demultiplexing
and following match filtering. It is not designed to be invoked directly, but
its results will be returned automatically from
\code{\link{filter_demultiplex_res}}.
}
\details{
Following a uniform distribution of barcodes, the expected number
of barcode collisions
(observed barcodes combinations being composed of two or more cells)
is given by
\deqn{N\left(1-e^{-\lambda}-\lambda e^{-\lambda}\right),}
where \eqn{N} is the number of possible barcode combinations
and \eqn{\lambda} is in this summary referred to as the collision lambda.
\deqn{\lambda=\frac{n}{N},} where \eqn{n} is the number of cells,
but this entity is unknown as we cannot know how many cells
there were originally only based on the number of observed
barcodes due to potential collisions. Utilizing the fact that the expected
observed number of barcodes is given by
\deqn{N\left(1-e^{-\lambda}\right),}
we can correct the estimate for \eqn{\lambda} from the known value
of the observed barcode combinations, and thus estimate the number
of cells and barcode collisions.
