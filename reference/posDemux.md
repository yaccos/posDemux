# Utilities for segmented sequences with combinatorial barcoding

Provides tools for handling reads with combinatorial barcodes, and
multiple adapter regions. This includes utilities for demultiplexing,
sequence segmenting and filtering. The package is intended to work with
single-cell RNA-seq data with multiple barcoding (e.g. SPLiT-seq and
PETRI-seq).
