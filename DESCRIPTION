Description: Demultiplexing and filtering utilities intended for reads with
   combinatorial barcodes (i.e PETRI-seq and SPLiT-seq). The demultiplexer algorithm
   is based on the position of the segments to extract and compare the barcodes with the reference.
   A Shiny application is provided to interactively select cutoffs for which barcode
   combinations to keep.
