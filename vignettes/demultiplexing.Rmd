# Basics

## Install `posDemux`

`R` is an open-source statistical environment which can be easily modified to enhance its functionality via packages. `r Biocpkg("posDemux")` is a `R` package available via the [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org) repository for packages. `R` can be installed on any operating system from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) after which you can install `r Biocpkg("posDemux")` by using the following commands in your `R` session:

```{r "install", eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
      install.packages("BiocManager")
  }

BiocManager::install("posDemux")

## Check that you have a valid Bioconductor installation
BiocManager::valid()
```

## Required knowledge

`r Biocpkg("posDemux")` is based on many other packages and in particular in those that have implemented the infrastructure needed for dealing with RNA-seq data (EDIT!). That is, packages like `r Biocpkg("SummarizedExperiment")` (EDIT!).

If you are asking yourself the question "Where do I start using Bioconductor?" you might be interested in [this blog post](http://lcolladotor.github.io/2014/10/16/startbioc/#.VkOKbq6rRuU).

## Asking for help

As package developers, we try to explain clearly how to use our packages and in which order to use the functions. But `R` and `Bioconductor` have a steep learning curve so it is critical to learn where to ask for help. The blog post quoted above mentions some but we would like to highlight the [Bioconductor support site](https://support.bioconductor.org/) as the main resource for getting help: remember to use the `posDemux` tag and check [the older posts](https://support.bioconductor.org/tag/posDemux/). Other alternatives are available such as creating GitHub issues and tweeting. However, please note that if you want to receive help you should adhere to the [posting guidelines](http://www.bioconductor.org/help/support/posting-guide/). It is particularly critical that you provide a small reproducible example and your session information so package developers can track down the source of the error.

## Citing `posDemux`

We hope that `r Biocpkg("posDemux")` will be useful for your research. Please use the following information to cite the package and the overall approach. Thank you!

```{r "citation"}
## Citation info
citation("posDemux")
```

# Quick start to using `posDemux`

```{r "start", message=FALSE}
library("posDemux")
```

Edit this as you see fit =)

Here is an example of you can cite your package inside the vignette:

* `r Biocpkg("posDemux")` `r Citep(bib[["posDemux"]])`



# Reproducibility

The `r Biocpkg("posDemux")` package `r Citep(bib[["posDemux"]])` was made possible thanks to:

* R `r Citep(bib[["R"]])`
* `r Biocpkg("BiocStyle")` `r Citep(bib[["BiocStyle"]])`
* `r CRANpkg("knitr")` `r Citep(bib[["knitr"]])`
* `r CRANpkg("RefManageR")` `r Citep(bib[["RefManageR"]])`
* `r CRANpkg("rmarkdown")` `r Citep(bib[["rmarkdown"]])`
* `r CRANpkg("sessioninfo")` `r Citep(bib[["sessioninfo"]])`
* `r CRANpkg("testthat")` `r Citep(bib[["testthat"]])`

This package was developed using `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("biocthis")`.

`R` session information.

```{r reproduce3, echo=FALSE}
## Session info
library("sessioninfo")
options(width = 120)
session_info()
```
